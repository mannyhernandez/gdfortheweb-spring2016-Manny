<h1>A Dream, A Quote</h1>

<h2>by Edgar Allan Poe and Dr. Seuss</h2>

<br><br>

<section>In visions of the dark night<br><br>
I have dreamed of joy departed
<h1>How did it get so late so soon?</h1>

But a waking dream of life and light<br><br>
Hath left me broken-hearted.

<h1>It's night before it's afternoon.</h1>
Ah! what is not a dream by day<br><br>
To him whose eyes are cast
<h1>My goodness how the time has flewn.</h1>
Turned back upon the past?<br><br>
On things around him with a ray
<h1>December is here before it's June.</h1>
While all the world were chiding,<br><br>
That holy dream- that holy dream,

<h1>How did it get so late so soon?</h1>
A lonely spirit guiding.<br><br>
What though that light, thro' storm and night,<br><br>
So trembled from afar-
What could there be more<br><br> purely bright
In Truth's day-star?<br><br><br>
