<section>In visions of the dark night<br>

<br>
I have dreamed of joy departed-</section <br><br>

But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me broken-hearted.<br><br>
Ah! what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast<br><br>
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past?<br><br>
That holy dream- that holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,<br><br>
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding.<br><br>
What though that light, thro' storm and night,<br><br>
So trembled from afar-
What could there be more<br><br> purely bright
In Truth's day-star?<br><br><br>

How did it get so late so soon?<br><br>
It's night before it's afternoon.<br><br>
December is here before it's June.<br><br> 
My goodness how the time has flewn. <br><br>
How did it get so late so soon?<br><br>
